# ICSNPP-ETHERCAT

Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat.

## Overview

ICSNPP-Ethercat is a Zeek plugin for parsing and logging fields within the Ethercat protocol.

This plugin was developed to be fully customizable, so if you would like to drill down into specific Ethercat packets and log certain variables, add the logging functionality to [scripts/icsnpp/ethercat/main.zeek](scripts/icsnpp/ethercat/main.zeek). The functions within [scripts/icsnpp/ethercat/main.zeek](scripts/icsnpp/ethercat/main.zeek) and [src/events.bif](src/events.bif) should prove to be a good guide on how to add new logging functionality.

This parser produces 8 log files. These log files are defined in [scripts/icsnpp/ethercat/main.zeek](scripts/icsnpp/ethercat/main.zeek).
* ecat_registers.log
* ecat_log_address.log
* ecat_dev_info.log 
* ecat_aoe_info.log 
* ecat_coe_info.log 
* ecat_foe_info.log 
* ecat_soe_info.log 
* ecat_arp_info.log 

For additional information on these log files, see the *Logging Capabilities* section below.

## Installation

### Installing Zeek

### Package Manager

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manger](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html)

```bash
zkg refresh
zkg install icsnpp-ethercat
```

If this package is installed from ZKG it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -N`. If installed correctly you will see `ICSNPP::ETHERCAT`.

If you have ZKG configured to load packages (see @load packages in quickstart guide), this plugin and scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.
[ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)

If you are not using site/local.zeek or another site installation of Zeek and just want to run this package on a packet capture you can add `icsnpp/ethercat` to your command to run this plugin's scripts on the packet capture:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/icsnpp-ethercat.git
zeek -Cr icsnpp-ethercat/tests/traces/ethercat_example.pcap icsnpp/ethercat
```


## Manual Install
To install this package manually, clone this repository and run the configure and make commands as shown below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/icsnpp-ethercat.git
cd icsnpp-ethercat/
./configure
make
```
If these commands succeed, you will end up with a newly created build directory which contains all the files needed to run/test this plugin. The easiest way to test the parser is to point the ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to this build directory.

```bash
export ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH=$PWD/build/
zeek -N # Ensure everything compiled correctly and you are able to see ICSNPP::ETHERCAT
```
Once you have tested the functionality locally and it appears to have compiled correctly, you can install it system-wide:

```bash
sudo make install
unset ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH
zeek -N # Ensure everything installed correctly and you are able to see ICSNPP::ETHERCAT
```
To run this plugin in a site deployment you will need to add the line @load icsnpp/ethercat to your site/local.zeek file in order to load this plugin's scripts.

If you are not using site/local.zeek or another site installation of Zeek and just want to run this package on a packet capture you can add icsnpp/ethercat to your command to run this plugin's scripts on the packet capture:

```bash
zeek -Cr icsnpp-ethercat/tests/traces/ethercat_example.pcap icsnpp/ethercat
```
If you want to deploy this plugin on an already existing Zeek implementation and you don't want to build the plugin on the machine, you can extract the ICSNPP_ETHERCAT.tgz file to the directory of the established ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH (default is ${ZEEK_INSTALLATION_DIR}/lib/zeek/plugins/).

```bash
tar xvzf build/ICSNPP_Ethercat.tgz -C $ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH 
```
## Logging Capabilities

### ECAT Registers (ecat_registers.log)

#### Overview

This log captures register memory address read and writes **ecat_registers.log**.

This log is also the catch all. Before it gets to this point it is sent through the more parsing routines to pull out any other information. ie. CoE, AoE, FoE, EoE, and SoE mailbox data.
